      <description>Semiochemicals: chemicals used by organisms for the purpose of communication. Never heard of them? You certainly have, but under different names&amp;hellip; Pheromones are in fact a type of semiochemical that are used to communicate with members of the same species. But there are more. Organisms can also communicate between species using chemical cues. Flowers for example, smell nice because they want to attract pollinators. The chemicals produced in this scenario are often called allomones because they are beneficial to the originator, but they may also act as kairomones, which are chemical cues that are beneficial for the receiver, that is, IF the flower provides a nectar reward.</description>
