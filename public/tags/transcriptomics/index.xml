      <description>Developmental and Phenotypic Plasticity An organism&amp;rsquo;s phenotype is the product of its genes and its environment. This plasticity is considered adaptive when changes in phenotype in response to a specific environmental condition improve the organism&amp;rsquo;s fitness. Adaptive developmental plasticity is therefore an interesting mechanism for coping with environmental heterogeneity. I am interested in understanding the molecular mechanism that underlie the regulation of plastic phenotypes. We apply genomic techniques including RNAseq and ATACseq to study the generation of environmentally sensitive phenotypes.</description>

      <description>An organism’s capacity to track and resemble its background (‘background matching’) is an important cryptic mechanism in the animal kingdom. Some species have evolved facultative colour change, a remarkable form of phenotypic plasticity, to match temporally or spatially heterogeneous backgrounds. Here, we quantify the capacity of such facultative changes in pigmentation in Western Spadefoot tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes), by manipulating the background colour of aquaria. We find that tadpoles of this species are capable of detecting and responding to even minor changes in background brightness by adjusting the pigmentation content in their skin.</description>
